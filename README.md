# Galaxy Type ML Dataset

This repository contains a curated dataset and data preparation scripts for training machine learning models to classify galaxies by morphological type.

---

## Project Objective

The goal is to enable classification of galaxies based on image data into the following categories:

- Barred Spiral
- Elliptical
- Irregular
- Lenticular
- Spiral

This dataset can be used for training deep learning models (e.g., CNNs) and experimenting with astrophysical image classification tasks.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into separate training and test sets, with images grouped into 5 galaxy types.
